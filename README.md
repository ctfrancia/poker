# Poker

The idea of this app is to create an api for home poker usage.

## What this api does not do
- Play poker
- Manage payments
- Mange timer


## What this api WILL do
- Register a new poker group
- Register players in that poker group
- Follow players in the group(for accumulated loss/profit) profiling
- Save game timers/variables (re-buy time, time per blinds, number of payouts/ payment percentages)
- Save game results
